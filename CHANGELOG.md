- Dashboard metric presentation aligned around issue-centric stats while preserving compatibility fields for task-related selector consumers

### Fixed

## [0.3.13] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- GitHub, GitLab, and Linear issue provider integration with bidirectional sync — pull remote issues into local workspace, push local changes back, and manage connections via Project Settings UI
- Remote issue MCP tools (`search_remote_issues`, `get_remote_issue`, `comment_remote_issue`) for AI agent access to external issue trackers
- Project Settings modal with provider add wizard, edit dialog, connection testing, and manual sync trigger
- Provider quick switcher for filtering the issue list by repository
- Batch operations toolbar with multi-select (Cmd/Ctrl+Click) for bulk status, priority, label, and delete actions
- Remote source metadata display in issue detail view (remote number, state, sync time)
- "Publish to remote" toggle in AI Issue Creator for creating issues directly on connected repositories

### Changed
- Streaming performance: dedicated progress throttle channel (200ms/5fps) reduces IPC round-trips by 75% for tool output while maintaining 50ms/20fps for text streaming
- StreamingMessageBuffer provides O(1) zero-copy streaming via direct ManagedSession reference
- DataBus skips expensive snapshotState() for non-mutating forwarding events during streaming
- IPC progress strings capped at 8000 characters to reduce structured-clone overhead
- Issue detail view layout simplified from resizable PanelGroup to fixed layout

## [0.3.12] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Editing support for queued items during sequential agent dispatch (#10)

### Changed
- GitHub Actions upgraded to Node.js 24 compatible versions: checkout v6, setup-node v6, pnpm/action-setup v5, node 22 LTS (#12)

### Fixed
- Streaming rendering pipeline optimized end-to-end for reduced latency (#11)
- Collapsed sub-issues no longer leak as orphan items in issue views (#9)
- Memory extraction now skips assistant responses in slash-command-driven turns to prevent template pollution (#7)

## [0.3.11] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Engine-agnostic sessions with seamless per-turn engine switching — changing the default AI engine in Settings takes effect on the next message without restarting the session
- Structured dev-tracing logs across session lifecycle (QueryLifecycle, SessionOrchestrator, ManagedSession state transitions)
- Structured dev-tracing logs across memory system lifecycle (extraction, quality gate, retrieval, debounce queue)
- Project name display for project-scoped memories in list (e.g., "Project · OpenCow")

### Changed
- Memory maxContentLength raised from 500 to 1000 to accommodate structured knowledge
- Scope terminology unified: "User" → "Global" across memory UI
- Settings switch components (Updates, Memory) now reuse shared `Switch` from `ui/switch`

### Fixed
- Engine drift detection now runs before fast path in `resumeSessionInternal`, preventing silent engine switch ignoring for active sessions
- Silent memory loss from oversized content: three-layer defense (raised limit, prompt constraint, graceful truncation)
- Zero-candidate extraction failures now log diagnostic details (response structure, filter reasons)

## [0.3.10] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Persistent memory system with LLM extraction, merge, quality gate, and management UI
- Cross-scope memory extraction with LLM-driven scope classification (user vs project)
- Memory Toast for real-time memory confirmation/editing with merge diff view
- MemoryView panel with search, category filter, bulk operations, and project scoping
- Memory Settings section with extraction delay configuration
- HeadlessLLMClient using Vercel AI SDK for engine-agnostic memory extraction

### Changed
- RepoAnalyzer migrated to SessionOrchestrator for engine-agnostic marketplace analysis
- Provider auth system extended with HTTPAuth abstraction and engine-specific API key providers (AnthropicApiKeyProvider / OpenAIApiKeyProvider)
- Memory extraction content strategy: full conversation with turn-based recent-priority compression (replaces last-10-messages window)
- Extraction pipeline excludes non-conversational sessions (market-analyzer, schedule)

### Fixed
- CapabilityCacheManager infinite recursion on package install (invalidate → dispatch → invalidate loop)
- MCP server configuration extracted to shared module to prevent SDK fatal exits
- UI lag during active agent streaming reduced
- Marketplace InstallDialog prevents Install button on empty/failed analysis results
